## Changes
2019 represents a lot of changes in my life: I'm graduating college, ending my career as an NCAA Division 1 athlete, starting my first real job, moving into my first real house, etcetera. I guess you could say I'm growing up. As I make these significant life changes, I am beginning to realize the importance of documentation. I intend to use this website for personal growth, and presumably to share some useful learnings along the way. 

## Blog
The [Blog](/blog) section of this website will be something like a journal for me - A place to reflect on day-to-day occurrences, share news about my life, and summarize new things I'm learning.

## Product Management

The [Product Managment](/product_management) section of this website is probably the area I'm most excited to write. There are plenty of fantastic PM blogs out there - including (among others) Ken Norton's Blog, Mind the Product and Intercom's Product Blog. However, during my hiring process and my first month as a PM, I realized that there weren't nearly enough blogs written by new/young PMs. I frequently find myself more interested in the learning journey than in the final product. So hopefully, the product management section of this site can begin to document and share some of my insights and learnings as I start my journey down the PM career path. 

## Learning Materials
The [Learning Materials](/resources) section will contain materials that have been beneficial to me in my career growth. It will include books, articles, podcasts, etcetera. 

## Photography
The photography section will include photos I've taken and pictures of my experiences taken by friends and family. Photography is a relatively new hobby for me, so most of my photos will be tied to blog posts explaining my learning process. 

## About
The About page contains general information about my life and will be updated periodically.
